# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# *In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized*

# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science.
# - Introduce arithmetic expression examples in Python.
# - Demonstrate multiplication and addition operations in code.
# - Convert minutes to hours using Python.
# - libraries used by Data Scientists. 
# -  How to Use markdowns (Titles, Numburing lists , bullet points list and tables).  

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Julia
# 5. MATLAB
# 6. Scala
# 7. Java
# 8. C/C++
# 9. SAS
# 10. Perl
# 

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# - NumPy: for numerical computing and array manipulation
# - pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
# - Matplotlib: for data visualization
# - scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and tools
# - TensorFlow: for deep learning and neural networks
# - PyTorch: for deep learning and neural networks
# - Keras: for building and training neural networks
# - SciPy: for scientific computing and statistical functions
# - Seaborn: for statistical data visualization
# - XGBoost: for gradient boosting algorithms
# - LightGBM: for gradient boosting algorithms

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 
# - Addition: `2 + 3 = 5`
# - Subtraction: `10 - 5 = 5`
# - Multiplication: `4 * 6 = 24`
# - Division: `12 / 3 = 4`
# - Exponentiation: `2 ** 4 = 16`
# - Modulo (Remainder): `10 % 3 = 1`
# 
# These are just a few basic examples, but Python supports a wide range of arithmetic operations and expressions.
# 

# In[4]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)


# In[5]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
